A number of runners, both from the NUnit project and by third parties, are able to execute NUnit tests.

Version 2.6 is the seventh major release of this well-known and well-tested programming tool.

This package includes the NUnit console, gui and pnunit runners and is compatible with all NUnit framework versions 2.0 through 2.6. The NUnit project editor is also included.

This unofficial package is limited to run on the 4.x framework which improves compatibility with Mono when running tests compiled for 4.x.</dc:description><dc:identifier>NUnit.Runners.Net4</dc:identifier><version>2.6.4</version><dc:language>en-US</dc:language><keywords>nunit test testing tdd runner mono crossplatform</keywords><dc:title>NUnit.Runners.Net4</dc:title><lastModifiedBy>NuGet, Version=2.8.50926.602, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null;Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0;.NET Framework 4</lastModifiedBy></coreProperties>
